# PredictStream - Development Tasks

This document outlines all the tasks that need to be completed to build the PredictStream application. These tasks are organized by Pull Request (PR) milestones to ensure a structured development process with regular validation points.

After completing a milestone, create a pull request with your changes for review before moving to the next milestone. Each PR should contain a manageable set of features that can be tested together. **IMPORTANT**: Each PR must include appropriate tests to verify the functionality being added.
