- **Time Series Analysis**: If time-based data is detected, provide time series plots and decomposition

### 3. Data Visualization

- **Interactive Charts**: Create interactive visualizations with Plotly
- **Chart Types**: Support various visualization types:
  - Scatter plots (with optional trend lines)
  - Bar charts and histograms
  - Box plots and violin plots
  - Heatmaps
  - Pair plots for feature relationships
- **Customization**: Allow basic customization of chart appearance (titles, labels, colors)
- **Export**: Enable saving visualizations as PNG/JPG files

### 4. Predictive Modeling

- **Problem Type Detection**: Suggest classification or regression based on target variable
- **Model Selection**: Offer a curated selection of models:
  - **Classification**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

- **Hyperparameter Selection**: Provide simplified hyperparameter options for each model

### 5. Model Evaluation

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - **Classification**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
  - **Regression**: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R-squared
- **Visualizations**:
  - **Classification**: Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, Precision-Recall Curve
  - **Regression**: Actual vs Predicted Plot, Residual Plot
- **Feature Importance**: Show and visualize importance of features in the model
- **Model Explanation**: Provide basic model interpretability using techniques like SHAP values

### 6. Prediction Capability

- **New Data Prediction**: Allow prediction on new data points using UI inputs
- **Batch Prediction**: Enable predictions on new datasets (uploaded separately)
- **Export Results**: Provide option to download prediction results as CSV

## User Interface Requirements

### 1. Layout & Navigation

- **Branding**: Include NeurArk branding (logo, colors) in a subtle manner
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Prioritize important information through layout and typography

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Performance

- **Efficient Data Handling**: Use appropriate techniques for larger datasets
- **Caching**: Implement caching for expensive operations (data processing, model training)
- **Optimization**: Balance functionality with performance considerations

### 2. Code Quality

- **Modular Structure**: Organize code into logical modules and functions
- **Documentation**: Include comprehensive docstrings and comments
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust exception handling
- **Type Hints**: Use Python type hints for improved code quality

### 3. Deployment Considerations

- **Accessibility**: Follow basic accessibility best practices
- **Responsiveness**: The UI should respond quickly to user interactions

### 2. Quality

- **Polish**: The application should appear professional and well-crafted
- **Robustness**: Handle edge cases and unexpected inputs gracefully
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent terminology and interaction patterns

## Demo Scenarios

The application should excel at demonstrating these common scenarios:

1. **Quick EDA**: Upload a dataset and quickly generate key insights and visualizations
2. **Model Comparison**: Train multiple models on the same dataset and compare their performance
3. **Feature Analysis**: Identify the most important features driving predictions
4. **Interactive Exploration**: Allow stakeholders to interactively explore data relationships

## Limitations (Acceptable for Demo)

As this is a demonstration project, the following limitations are acceptable:

- Performance with very large datasets (>100MB) may be limited
- No user authentication or multi-user support
- No persistent storage of results between sessions
- Limited to tabular data (no image, text, or specialized data formats)

## Development Priorities

1. **User Experience**: Focus on creating an intuitive, polished interface
2. **Visual Appeal**: Ensure visualizations and UI components look professional
3. **Core Functionality**: Implement the core features completely before adding extras
4. **Performance**: Ensure the application runs smoothly with reasonable-sized datasets
